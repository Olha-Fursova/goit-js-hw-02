# JavaScript Homework 02 – Branching and Loops  

## Project Overview  
This project is a set of JavaScript exercises that practice the use of **branching** (`if`, `switch`) and **loops**, focusing on real-life examples of decision-making and text processing.  

The tasks include:  
1. **Droid Order Transaction** – Implementing purchase logic with credit validation.  
2. **Message Formatting** – Cutting or preserving messages depending on a maximum length.  
3. **Spam Detection** – Checking strings for forbidden words (`spam`, `sale`) regardless of case.  
4. **Shipping Cost Calculation** – Using a `switch` statement to determine delivery prices based on the country.  

## File Structure  
Each task is implemented in a separate file inside the project folder:  

goit-js-hw-02/ 

├── js/  
│ ├── task-1.js  
│ ├── task-2.js  
│ ├── task-3.js  
│ └── task-4.js

└── README.md  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Click on GitHub Pages link in description to this project.  
3. Open the browser console (DevTools → Console) to see the results of function calls.  

## Conclusions

- Learned how to apply conditional statements to handle multiple cases.

- Improved understanding of function parameters and return values.

- Practiced string manipulation (slicing, concatenation, case-insensitive checks).

- Applied the switch statement in real-world-like tasks (shipping calculation).

- Ensured clean, formatted code with Prettier and validated correctness in the browser console.

- This project demonstrates the ability to solve practical problems with branching logic in JavaScript.
